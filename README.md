-  Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman?
 Ada Lovelace is considered the world's first computer programmer. In the 1800s, she worked on Charles Babbage's early mechanical computer,
 the "Analytical Engine." Ada wrote an algorithm to calculate Bernoulli numbers,
 which is considered the first computer program!
 Her contributions were so groundbreaking that she is often credited with envisioning the potential of computers far beyond simple calculation tasks.
